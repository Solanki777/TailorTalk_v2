Tailortalk is a production-grade AI-powered assistant designed to bridge the gap between human language and structured cloud storage. By leveraging **LangGraph** for deterministic orchestration and **Groq** for high-speed LLM inference, Tailortalk transforms Google Drive from a static file repository into a conversational discovery engine.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

### The Problem
Traditional file search relies on exact keyword matching and rigid folder hierarchies. Users often struggle to find documents unless they remember the precise filename or location, leading to significant productivity loss in large-scale corporate environments.

### The Solution
Tailortalk introduces **Conversational Retrieval**. It allows users to query their Google Drive using natural, ambiguous language. The system extracts intent, maintains conversational memory, and executes deterministic search queries, providing a human-centric layer over the Google Drive API.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Semantic Intent Extraction**: Precisely identifies filters (MIME types, dates, owners, folders) from natural language using Pydantic v2 validation.
- **🧠 Conversational Memory**: State-aware architecture that allows for iterative refinement (e.g., *"Show my PDFs"* followed by *"Only the ones from last week"*).
- **📊 Intelligent Ranking Engine**: A 100-point scoring algorithm that ranks results based on name similarity, recency, and ownership.
- **🔁 Deduplication & Grouping**: Advanced post-processing pipeline that collapses exact duplicates and groups visually similar results.
- **❓ Proactive Clarification**: Gracefully handles vague or broad queries by requesting specific missing parameters.
- **🔒 Deterministic Query Building**: Unlike "Black Box" AI, Tailortalk uses a deterministic builder—ensuring the LLM never generates raw API queries directly.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Tailortalk follows a decoupled architecture, separating the LLM-powered intelligence layer from the deterministic business logic.

### Request Lifecycle & Orchestration
The core logic is orchestrated via a **LangGraph State Machine**, ensuring a predictable and traceable execution path:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User([User Message]) --> API[FastAPI Entrypoint]
    API --> Graph{LangGraph Orchestrator}
    
    subgraph "AI Intelligence Layer"
        Graph --> Intent[Intent Extraction Node]
        Intent --> Groq1((Groq LLM))
    end
    
    subgraph "Deterministic Logic Layer"
        Intent --> Query[Query Builder]
        Query --> Drive[Google Drive API]
        Drive --> Processing[Post-Processing Node]
        Processing --> Dedup[Deduplication]
        Processing --> Ranking[Ranking Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph "Response Generation"
        Ranking --> Formatter[Response Formatter Node]
        Formatter --> Groq2((Groq LLM))
    end
    
    Formatter --> UI[Streamlit UI / Result Cards]
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Solanki777/EasyFetch.git
cd Tailortalk
```

### 2. Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Google Drive Authentication
Tailortalk uses **Application Default Credentials (ADC)**. Run the following command and follow the browser prompts:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```
*Ensure the Drive API is enabled in your Google Cloud Project console.*

### 4. Configuration
The system requires a `.env` file in the root directory to store sensitive API keys.

1.  **Create the file:**
    ```bash
    touch .env  # Or create a new file named .env in the root folder
    ```
2.  **Add your Groq API Key:**
    Visit [Groq Cloud Console](https://console.groq.com/keys) to generate a key.
    ```env
    GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
    LLM_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192
    BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tailortalk will not start without a valid `GROQ_API_KEY`.** This key powers the intent extraction and response formatting layers.

### 5. Launch the System
Tailortalk includes a unified startup script to launch both services:
```bash
python start.py both
```

## 🛡️ Production Engineering Highlights

### Deterministic Orchestration
Unlike traditional agents that "loop" indefinitely, Tailortalk uses a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. This ensures that every request follows a validated, predictable path from intent to result, critical for enterprise reliability.

### Separation of Intelligence and Execution
We treat the LLM as a **Translation Layer**, not an Execution Layer. The LLM translates natural language into a validated `SearchIntent` object. All interactions with the Google Drive API are then handled by deterministic Python code.

### Typed Data Integrity
The entire pipeline is built on **Pydantic v2**. This ensures that every piece of data—from the user's intent to the Drive file metadata—is validated against strict schemas before being processed.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Potential Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Path resolution error | Run with `python start.py` or set `PYTHONPATH=.` |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid Google Credentials | Re-run `gcloud auth application-default login` |
| `Groq API Error` | Missing/Expired API Key | Check `.env` for `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| `Backend Unreachable` | Backend process not running | Ensure `python start.py backend` is active |
